# Dotfiles

A small collection of `.dotfiles` designed to make a production environment developer-friendly and simple to use.

The simple [`install.sh`](./install.sh) script will also install [Oh-My-ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
so that we're using a lovely `zsh` client :)

Production environments can be as friendly as developer environments!
